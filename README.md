## What is OnRepeat+ ?

OnRepeat+ is an application that allows a Spotify User to get 90 recommended songs based oh their curent "On Repeat" playlist and their audio features. The recommended songs can com from either a provided dataSet containing over 10'000 songs (mainly songs in English) or the user can also provide the ID of a playlist they want to get the recommendations from. The process would hoever be slower as the application needs to fetch and process all the data on through the spotify API. If the user wants to, the recommendations can be saved in a csv file.
